Marketing;Influencer Marketing Strategy;Greg Jarboe;Influencer marketing is the practice of engaging internal and industry experts with active networks to help achieve measurable business goals.

Personal Development;Estilos de Liderazgo: opciones para avanzar en desafíos complejos;Maite Careaga Tagüeña ;Liderazgo es una palabra que se usa para muchas cosas diferentes y a veces opuestas. Cuando la gente intenta concertar una definición, hay una tendencia general a recurrir al modelo heroico del liderazgo, de un hombre con características especiales y en un puesto directivo que convence a otros de seguirlo hacia su visión. Este modelo es atractivo, pero limitado y obsoleto para la mayoría de los desafíos que nos importan hoy en día. El “modelo heroico” suele ser muy útil para solucionar problemas que no requieren cambios en las personas involucradas en solucionarlos, pero es menos útil o incluso factible para progresar en la solución de problemas difíciles de definir, en situaciones en que hay mucha incertidumbre, y cuando parte importante del problema son las decisiones hábitos y miedos de la propia gente (tú incluida/o) que necesita trabajar para llegar a la solución.

Business Essentials;What is Corruption: Anti-Corruption and Compliance;Andrew Kandel;Have you ever paid someone for doing you a favor?  You may be accustomed to tipping wait staff or other service providers, but what if you paid a police officer for NOT issuing a parking ticket?  Or if you gave a “gift” to a government official for signing a contract with your company? Tipping might be okay, but paying a bribe is a violation of the law.    Bribery is widespread and exists almost everywhere and in many forms.  Compliance programs address this and other forms of corruption.    In this course we’ll discuss what corruption actually is by examining, for example, the difference between a tip and an illegal bribe.  We will examine where corruption exists, how it exists, its ramifications, and the genesis of today’s anti-corruption laws.  We’ll also focus on practical strategies for creating compliance policies and procedures that address and prevent corruption.  We will learn about the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and many other anti-corruption laws.  Much of the course will focus on building out compliance policies and procedures that address corruption.  We will also look at practical methods for preventing corruption in an organization as well as red flags and other mechanisms for identifying corruption early so that it can be adequately addressed.

Marketing;Strategic Innovation: Building and Sustaining Innovative Organizations;Raj Echambadi ;Innovation strategy is about creating unique value for consumers by delivering a great product that satisfies their needs. At the core of a successful innovation strategy is a great product concept. Product is an all-encompassing term that includes physical goods, intangible services, and even ideas. There are three pillars to a successful product strategy: a clear understanding of (a) the target customers (WHO), (b) the specific elements of the product offering (WHAT) that satisfies consumer needs and dovetails with company capabilities, and (c) the tactical plans to reach end consumers (HOW). The value proposition has to be embedded in a coherent business model in order to create and capture value. But well-laid innovation plans can go awry without a consideration of the business ecosystem that includes competitors and collaborators, including suppliers, distributors, and retailers, or the contextual environment in which the company operates. In an interdependent world, fostering an integrated ecosystem is critically important for companies interested in maximizing the odds of innovation success.  You will be able to:  - Understand key ideas about innovation and product strategy - Strategize for value capture in a business model - Critically examine the roles of various players in a business ecosystem   This course is part of Gies College of Business’ suite of online programs, including the iMBA and iMSM.
